## How to Code
Many people believe that software engineering technique such as coding standard help improve the overall codng quality. However, I personally agree at some degree but not all of the it. After your first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, I find green checkmark very useful. However, I find my coding style have been changing due to these green checkmark. For some progrmming lanaguge such as python, spacing is very imporatant part of coding itself. Not only it help the reader to keep track of the code, but also it make the code look alot nicer. Furthermore, it easier to debug when the code are written in coding standard since it allow the eye to track every tiny bit of code alot faster. However, spacing in coding did take up some space in the progromming itself which can potential cause some delay espically when the progrmming size is very large. There are also increase of coding time due to the extra spacings in the progrom. If time is a very important factor, it could potential cause you miss your deadline. It is standard process for progrmmer to keep the same coding style to avoid confusion for reader.     

## Build Good Habits 
It important to keep a constant coding style for pratice ONLY. Code style or just some old habits are something we build overtime. Some poeple may find it easier while some may find it diffcult to read. Even if the code are all written in a single line of code, when it complied into machine lanauge it will work as it intend. However, it will be very diffcult to keep check of everything going in the code. In the real world, most progromer follow code standard in most case. There are few progromer that just progrom however they see fit, but it may not be very fun for people who have to read it. For the most part, I agree code standard are important but it very on the siution and the needs. Afterall, there are not point of coding in a group when no one understand what you doing.
