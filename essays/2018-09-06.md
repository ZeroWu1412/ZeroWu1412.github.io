Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, 
how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions,
how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.

## Not Smart Enough
Asking question is the most common and effective method of learning, but as Eric Raymond explianed, you have to do your homework before asking the question.
Basic understanding of the question and materials are very important. Even some hacker happen to pass-by and give you a free pass that doe not mean it the pass you 
need.
