My personal goal for this project is to have to get more experience on application creation. I find these experiences to be very useful in the field and it a good presentation to shows what I have work on and skill. Making selling produce page have become a very common in the modern day, it will be useful when I want to create my own product page in the future.

From this project, I gain a lot of experience creating application and teamwork. Iâ€™m responsible for creating the landing page, user home page, constant style and polishing, and the merging all the small issue to the master in github. Furthermore, I was in charge of our homepage. Merging all the branches in github is proved to be difficult, unless the master is constantly been update.
