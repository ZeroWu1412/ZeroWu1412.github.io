This is a very simple eletrical circuit sovlver create using C++. It used the reduced row echelon equation to analyze the circuit and sovlve for voltage and current in all possible location of the simple circuit. Since this is a very simple project, we limited the components of the circuit to be resistors and copper wires only. Further improvement such as capacitors and inductors could also be added into the code. The code work just fine, however, the user input was limited to only number.
