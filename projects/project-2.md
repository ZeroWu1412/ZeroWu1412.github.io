This is a very simple eletrical circuit sovlver create using C++. It used the reduced row echelon equation to analyze the circuit and sovlve for voltage and current in all possible location of the simple circuit. Since this is a very simple project, we limited the components of the circuit to be resistors and copper wires only. Further improvement such as capacitors and inductors could also be added into the code. The code work just fine, however, the user input was limited to only number.  

For this project, I was the leader and manager of the final product. Due to the limited time we are given, each memeber are assgin we some part of the coding. The code are shared in icloud9 where everyone can see the change and history when the code are edit or change. Once the code are completed. I did all the debug and test run to be sure everything are doing what its intended. There are alot of comments in the code which make it very simple to read and understand. We spended around 2 week doing this project.
